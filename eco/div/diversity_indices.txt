Shannon Diversity Index
This index is an index applied to biological systems by derived from a mathematical formula used in
communication area by Shannon in 1948 (Mandaville 2002). It’s the most preferred index among the
other diversity indices. The index values are between 0.0 – 5.0. Results are generally between 1.5 –
3.5, and it exceeds 4.5 very rarely. The values above 3.0 indicate that the structure of habitat is stable
and balanced; the values under 1.0 indicate that there are pollution and degradation of habitat
structure.
H’ = -Σ [ (ni / N) x (ln ni / N) ]
H’: Shannon Diversity Index
ni : Number of individuals belonging to i species
N : Total number of individuals


Simpson Diversity Index
It’s a diversity indices derived by Simpson in 1949 (Mandaville 2002). Simpson index values (∆) are
between 0 – 1. But while calculating, final result is subtracted from 1 to correct the inverse proportion.
1 - ∆ = [ Σ ni (ni -1) ] / N (N-1)
∆ : Simpson Diversity Index
ni : Number of individuals belonging to i species
N : Total number of individuals


Margalef Diversity Index
It has no limit value and it shows a variation depending upon the number of species. Thus, it’s used for
comparison the sites (Kocataş 1992).
d = (S-1) / ln N
d : Margalef Diversity Index
S : Total number of species
N : Total number of individuals


McIntosh Diversity Index
It was suggested by McIntosh in 1967. The values are between 0 – 1. When the value is getting closer
to 1, it means that the organisms in a community are homogeneously distributed (McIntosh 1967).
Mc = [ N - √(∑ni2) ] / [ N - √N ]
Mc : McIntosh Diversity Index
ni : Number of individuals belonging to i species
N : Total number of individuals


Pielou Evenness Index
It was derived from Shannon index by Pielou in 1966. The ratio of the observed value of Shannon
index to the maximum value gives the Pielou Evenness Index result. The values are between 0 – 1.
When the value is getting closer to 1, it means that the individuals are distributed equally (Pielou
1966).
J’ = H’ / H’max
J’ : Pielou evenness index
H’ : The observed value of Shannon index
H’max : lnS
S : Total number of species


McIntosh Evenness Index
It was derived from McIntosh index. The values are between 0 – 1. When the value is getting closer to
1, it means that the individuals are distributed equally (Heip and Engels 1974).
Mc E = [ N - √(∑ni2) ] / [ N – (N /√S) ]
Mc E : McIntosh evenness index
ni: Number of individuals belonging to i species
S: Total number of species
N: Total number of individuals
